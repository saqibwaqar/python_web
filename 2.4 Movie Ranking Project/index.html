<h1>Movie Recommendations</h1>
<h2>Some of my most watched movies.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>Liked it because of its original screenplay and non-linear story telling.</p>

<h3>Django Unchained</h3>
<p>Great performances by the lead actors and a roller-coaster like story which keeps the viewer hooked throughout.</p>

<h3>Batman Begins</h3>
<p>One of the best works of Christopher Nolan. Music by Hans Zimmer is the cherry on top.</p>
